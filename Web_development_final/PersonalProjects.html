<p style = "font-size: 33px;"> In the past few years, I have very much enjoyed taking topics of interest and exploring them through coding simulations and programs.  It has become very fun.  Sadly it was not until the Fall of 2024 that I realize that commenting code is valuable.  These projects are not from this semester, and therefore the code is not commented nearly at all, and the design is also poor.  I just was trying to get the job done. Although the code looks messy, I think the products are halfway decent!  But they are not very updatable for reasons stated earlier. &#128546;</p><br><br>

<li>This first project was made because I was trying to improve my ability to memorize letters.  I use a technique called memorizing letters in pairs.  This program allows me to generate a large list of random letter pairs according to the alphabet I use.  Obviously there are random letter/string generators online, but the format of letter pairs and a custom alphabet is best implemented on your own.

<li>This project I made because I was studying the abstraction of Rubik's cube.  I was attempting to understand the larger class of games that Rubik's cube was built on, so I could potentially design many different similar puzzles of similar excitement.  The goal was to kind of make "legos" out of Rubik's cube type games, where you had pieces and you could put them together to make your own game.  This was the first simulation of what I call "permutation puzzles" which is the class of games I discovered the Rubik's cube falls nicely into.  Once I made this game, I realized that there were many things other than the actual game that made Rubik's cube exciting.  In short, It was the extremely elegant presentation, which this game did not have.

<li>This project was made when I was in my favorite class ever, graph theory.  On one of the first days of classes, I noticed that although two graphs may be the same, the image of the graph may be completely indistinguishable because of the location of the dots.  So, I decided to make a program showing two identical graphs side by side and Their dots in different places moving.  You can pause at any point, and marvel at how different they look even though they are the same graph, I guess.

<li>This is another project I made inspired by the graph theory class.  In graph theory, I learned about a type of graph called planar graphs.  These were graphs that could be drawn on a piece of paper without lines intersecting.  I wanted to be able to "play around" with moving the dots on the graph, so that you could try to uncross them through experimentation.  That is what this program accomplishes.  Although I made it so the graph is generated randomly, you don't have control over the graph you make.  I figured it was hard enough for me to do this, making a whole "sandbox" where you add edges and vertices would have been cool, but I didn't have the time.

I have made many more programs, but these are some of my best ideas.  At the point where I was making these programs, I was clearly not a programmer.  I just had ideas I wanted to implement.  I strive to be more of a programmer now.
