This project involves the study of Abstract Algebra.  I took a few Algebra classes, and I liked some things about the subject, and disliked others.  I liked that algebra appeared so universal to many subjects, and appeared to explain the structure of many things, including Rubik's cube, which I always was curious what math had to say about.  I disliked that the format of the study of abstract algebra felt uninspired.  It is hard to put into words without you being in my shoes (without minor experience with group theory I feel).  After reading my favorite math theorem of all time, Cayleys theorem, and the similar discussion of "Cayley Graphs", after a few years of pondering, I believe I am close to a better angle at understanding algebra, and a better framework to come at it than how it seems mathematicians normally do.  It is very silly of me to think anyone will not think I am a madman without giving them the details, but I guess that makes me silly.
